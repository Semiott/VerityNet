# StarkEx

StarkEx is a STARK-powered scalability engine for crypto exchanges. StarkEx uses cryptographic
proofs to attest to the validity of a batch of transactions (such as trades and transfers)
and updates a commitment to the state of the exchange onchain.

StarkEx allows exchanges to provide non-custodial trading at scale with high liquidity and lower
costs.
